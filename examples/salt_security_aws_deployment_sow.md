## Deployment Options Analysis

| Option | Complexity | Time | Success Rate | Architecture Fit | Missing Prerequisites | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------|------|
| **Multi-Layer Architecture** | 8/10 | 12-16 hours | 82% | Comprehensive coverage for complex architecture | None | Complete visibility, scalable, future-proof, handles all traffic types | Higher complexity, longer implementation, requires coordination |
| **Centralized CloudWatch** | 6/10 | 8-10 hours | 92% | Good for simplified management | None | Easier setup, lower complexity, good documentation | Limited ALB visibility, potential data gaps, less granular control |
| **API Gateway Only** | 4/10 | 4-6 hours | 95% | Quick deployment for API-focused environments | None | Simple implementation, quick deployment, well-tested, low risk | Limited coverage, missing ALB/ECS data, incomplete security view |

**Recommended Option**: Multi-Layer Architecture based on comprehensive traffic coverage requirements and complex infrastructure needs.

**Next Steps**: Once you chose the collector that suits you the most, I invite you to follow its deployment procedure through the dashboard, in the connector hub.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **ECS Service Mesh Complexity** | High | Medium | Start with critical services, expand gradually; use proven service mesh patterns |
| **IAM Permission Complexity** | Medium | High | Use infrastructure as code, test permissions incrementally, document all roles |
| **S3 Log Processing Latency** | Medium | Medium | Implement S3 event notifications, parallel processing, and monitoring |
| **CloudWatch Log Costs** | High | Low | Implement log filtering, retention policies, and cost monitoring |
| **Cross-Service Coordination** | Medium | Medium | Use phased deployment approach, maintain detailed implementation checklist |
| **Peak Traffic Handling** | Low | High | Load test during low-traffic periods, implement auto-scaling for collectors |
| **Data Loss During Transition** | Low | High | Implement parallel monitoring during transition, rollback procedures ready |
