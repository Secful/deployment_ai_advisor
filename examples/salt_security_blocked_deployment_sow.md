### Recommended Collectors - BLOCKED
- **collector_api_gateway**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Requires valid SSL certificates and Salt Hybrid v2.5.0+
- **collector_alb_logs**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Requires valid SSL certificates and Root CA configuration
- **collector_ecs_mesh**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Requires Salt Hybrid v2.5.0+ and valid certificates
- **collector_lambda**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Requires Salt Hybrid v2.5.0+ for advanced monitoring
- **collector_aggregator**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Cannot function without data from other collectors

## Missing Prerequisites Sections

### ⚠️ Deployment Blocked - Prerequisites Required

**Critical Prerequisites Missing**: The following prerequisites must be resolved before deployment can proceed:

**Missing Prerequisites Summary**:
- **CA Certificates**: Valid SSL certificates required for secure traffic collection
  - **Affected Collectors**: collector_api_gateway, collector_alb_logs, collector_ecs_mesh, collector_lambda
  - **Resolution Required**: Replace expired self-signed certificates with valid CA-signed certificates
  - **Business Impact**: Complete inability to establish secure collector connections

- **Salt Hybrid Version**: Minimum Salt Hybrid v2.5.0 required for advanced features
  - **Affected Collectors**: collector_ecs_mesh, collector_lambda, collector_aggregator
  - **Resolution Required**: Upgrade Salt Hybrid from v2.1.0 to v2.5.0 or higher
  - **Business Impact**: Cannot utilize advanced monitoring and correlation capabilities

- **Root CA Configuration**: Company Root CA missing for service-to-service communication
  - **Affected Collectors**: collector_alb_logs, collector_ecs_mesh
  - **Resolution Required**: Install and configure Company Root CA for internal communications
  - **Business Impact**: Cannot monitor internal service mesh communications

**Architecture Coverage Impact**:
- **API Gateway**: Complete traffic collection blocked
  - **Collectors Blocked**: collector_api_gateway
  - **Business Impact**: Zero visibility into API traffic, security threats undetected

- **Load Balancer**: ALB log collection impossible
  - **Collectors Blocked**: collector_alb_logs
  - **Business Impact**: Missing critical access logs and traffic patterns

- **ECS Services**: Service mesh monitoring unavailable
  - **Collectors Blocked**: collector_ecs_mesh
  - **Business Impact**: No insight into microservices communication and performance

- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless monitoring limited
  - **Collectors Blocked**: collector_lambda
  - **Business Impact**: Reduced visibility into serverless function performance and errors

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Address Prerequisites**: Resolve all missing prerequisites listed above
2. **Validation**: Validate prerequisite resolution in non-production environment
3. **Re-run Advisor**: Re-run deployment advisor after prerequisites are resolved
4. **Escalation**: Contact Salt Security support if prerequisites cannot be resolved

**Alternative Approaches**:
- Consider phased deployment starting with services where prerequisites are met
- Evaluate alternative collector configurations that may have fewer prerequisites
- Review architecture modifications that could reduce prerequisite complexity

## Deployment Options Analysis

| Option | Complexity | Time | Success Rate | Architecture Fit | Missing Prerequisites | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------|------|
| **Multi-Layer Architecture** | 8/10 | ⚠️ BLOCKED | 0% | Would provide comprehensive coverage | CA Certificates, Salt Hybrid v2.5.0+, Root CA | Complete visibility when prerequisites resolved | Cannot proceed until prerequisites resolved |
| **Centralized CloudWatch** | 6/10 | ⚠️ BLOCKED | 0% | Good for simplified management | CA Certificates, Salt Hybrid v2.5.0+ | Lower complexity when prerequisites resolved | Still requires prerequisite resolution |
| **API Gateway Only** | 4/10 | ⚠️ BLOCKED | 0% | Quick deployment when prerequisites met | CA Certificates, Salt Hybrid v2.5.0+ | Simple implementation after prerequisites | Cannot collect any traffic until resolved |

**Recommended Option**: ⚠️ **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED** - All deployment options require prerequisite resolution before proceeding.

**Next Steps**: Once prerequisites are resolved and you chose the collector that suits you the most, I invite you to follow its deployment procedure through the dashboard, in the connector hub.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Certificate Expiration Impact** | Critical | High | Immediate certificate replacement required; plan for automated renewal |
| **Salt Hybrid Upgrade Complexity** | High | High | Test upgrade in staging environment; plan for rollback procedures |
| **Root CA Configuration Issues** | Medium | High | Validate CA chain before deployment; test in isolated environment |
| **Business Continuity During Prerequisites Resolution** | High | Critical | Implement monitoring gaps mitigation; communicate impact to stakeholders |
| **Extended Resolution Timeline** | High | Medium | Set realistic expectations; consider external security consulting if needed |
