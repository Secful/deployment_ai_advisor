# Validator Agent Specification

## Overview
The validator agent specializes in verifying deployment completeness and success by comparing actual infrastructure state against planned deployment specifications (SOW). It performs comprehensive validation across all deployment components and generates actionable remediation reports for any gaps or issues found.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. SOW Comparison and Analysis
- **SOW Parsing**: Extract expected components and configurations from deployment SOW documents
- **Current State Assessment**: Analyze actual deployment state via Data Extractor
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing components, configuration mismatches, and incomplete deployments
- **Completeness Scoring**: Calculate deployment completeness percentage and success metrics

### 2. Component Validation
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Verify all required cloud resources are deployed and configured correctly
- **Service Health Checks**: Validate that all services are running and accessible
- **Network Connectivity**: Test network paths and security group configurations
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Verify monitoring systems are collecting data properly

### 3. Traffic Flow Validation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete traffic flow from source to collector
- **Data Collection Verification**: Confirm traffic data is being captured and stored
- **Performance Validation**: Check that performance meets expected thresholds
- **Error Rate Assessment**: Validate error rates are within acceptable limits

### 4. Compliance and Security Validation
- **Security Configuration**: Verify security groups, IAM roles, and access controls
- **Compliance Requirements**: Check deployment meets regulatory and organizational requirements
- **Best Practices Adherence**: Validate deployment follows recommended best practices
- **Documentation Completeness**: Ensure proper documentation and runbooks are in place
