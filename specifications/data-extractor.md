# Data Extractor Agent Specification

## Overview
The data-extractor agent serves as the centralized data hub for the deployment advisor system. It has exclusive access to Document360 MCP, coordinates with Salt API MCP, performs web searches, and analyzes historical session data to provide comprehensive information to other sub-agents.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Multi-Source Data Coordination
- **MCP Integration**: Primary interface to Salt API MCP and Document360 MCP
- **Web Search Coordination**: Perform targeted searches for knowledge gaps
- **Historical Session Analysis**: Mine past deployment sessions for insights
- **Data Source Credibility**: Score and prioritize information by source reliability

### 2. Document360 Knowledge Base Access
- **Exclusive MCP Access**: Only agent authorized to access Document360 MCP tools
- **Documentation Retrieval**: Search and retrieve Salt Security product documentation
- **Content Filtering**: Extract relevant sections for specific deployment scenarios
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Identify missing or outdated documentation

### 3. Cloud Asset Data Processing
- **Salt API MCP Interface**: Retrieve customer cloud asset information
- **Asset Pattern Analysis**: Identify deployment-relevant patterns
- **Architecture Reconstruction**: Build comprehensive architecture view
- **Change Detection**: Track and report infrastructure changes

### 4. Historical Intelligence
- **Session Pattern Matching**: Find similar past deployment sessions
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Calculate deployment success rates by pattern
- **Learning Integration**: Extract insights from anonymized session data
- **Trend Identification**: Identify common deployment challenges and solutions

```

## Data Source Priority and Credibility Scoring

### Priority Hierarchy (Descending Order)
```yaml
data_source_priority:
  1_salt_security_product_docs:
    source: "Document360 MCP"
    credibility_score: 10
    use_case: "Official product documentation and procedures"

  2_customer_architecture_data:
    source: "Salt API MCP"
    credibility_score: 9
    use_case: "Customer's actual infrastructure configuration"

  3_historical_customer_sessions:
    source: "Historical session analysis"
    credibility_score: 8
    use_case: "Proven successful deployment patterns"

  4_official_cloud_provider_docs:
    source: "Web search (official sites)"
    credibility_score: 7
    use_case: "Cloud provider best practices and configuration guides"

  5_community_proven_solutions:

    - flag_outdated_content: "Warn about potentially outdated information"
    - cross_reference_versions: "Verify information against multiple versions"
```

## Historical Session Analysis

### Session Similarity Scoring
```yaml
similarity_algorithm:
  architecture_matching:
    exact_match: 1.0  # Same cloud provider, same services
    cloud_provider_match: 0.8  # Same cloud provider, different services
    service_type_match: 0.6  # Different cloud provider, same service types
    complexity_match: 0.4  # Same complexity level, different architecture

  temporal_relevance:
    recent_sessions: +0.2  # Sessions from last 6 months
    older_sessions: -0.1   # Sessions older than 1 year

  outcome_weighting:
    successful_deployments: +0.3
    failed_deployments: -0.2
    partially_successful: +0.1
```

### Insight Extraction Patterns

    cache_key: "search_terms_hash + document_category"
    duration: 24_hours
    invalidation: "on documentation updates"

  web_search_cache:
    cache_key: "search_query_hash + target_domain"

  historical_analysis_cache:
    cache_key: "architecture_pattern_hash + similarity_threshold"
    duration: 7_days
    invalidation: "on new session data"
```

### Response Time Optimization
```yaml
performance_targets:
  simple_asset_query: "< 5 seconds"
