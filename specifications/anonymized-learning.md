# Anonymized Learning Sessions Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the anonymized learning session system for collecting deployment patterns and insights while protecting customer privacy in the Salt Security Deployment Advisor system. The system creates anonymized versions of customer sessions for machine learning and system improvement.

## Anonymization Architecture

### Core Anonymization Principles
```yaml
anonymization_principles:
  privacy_first:
    - zero_customer_identification: "No way to reverse-engineer customer identity"
    - data_minimization: "Only collect data necessary for learning"
    - purpose_limitation: "Use anonymized data only for system improvement"

  utility_preservation:
    - pattern_preservation: "Maintain architectural and deployment patterns"
    - relationship_preservation: "Keep logical relationships between components"
    - temporal_preservation: "Maintain timing and sequence information"

  technical_implementation:
    - cryptographic_hashing: "Use strong hashing for consistent anonymization"
    - uuid_replacement: "Replace identifiable names with UUIDs"
    - schema_compliance: "Maintain same data structure as customer sessions"
```

### Customer Identity Anonymization

#### Customer ID Transformation
```yaml
customer_id_anonymization:
  hashing_algorithm:
    method: "MD5 hash with salt"
    input: "api_key + system_salt"
    output_format: "customer-{md5_hash_8_chars}"
    example:
      original: "customer-xyz789"
      anonymized: "customer-a1b2c3d4"

  consistency_guarantee:
    same_customer_always_same_hash: true
    purpose: "Enable pattern analysis across same customer's sessions"
    implementation: "Deterministic hashing with fixed salt"

  collision_handling:
    collision_detection: "Check for hash collisions during generation"
    collision_resolution: "Add sequential suffix if collision detected"
    example_collision_resolution: "customer-a1b2c3d4-1"
```

#### Resource Name Anonymization
```yaml
resource_name_anonymization:
  naming_pattern_replacement:
    api_names:
      patterns: ["production-api", "my-api-gateway", "company-rest-api"]
      replacement: "api-{uuid4_short}"
      example: "production-api" → "api-1a2b3c4d"

    function_names:
      patterns: ["user-auth-function", "payment-processor", "data-validator"]
      replacement: "function-{uuid4_short}"
      example: "user-auth-function" → "function-5e6f7g8h"

    service_names:
      patterns: ["auth-service", "billing-microservice", "notification-svc"]
      replacement: "service-{uuid4_short}"
      example: "auth-service" → "service-9i0j1k2l"

    infrastructure_names:
      vpc_names:
        patterns: ["company-vpc", "prod-network", "secure-vpc"]
        replacement: "vpc-{uuid4_short}"

      subnet_names:
        patterns: ["private-subnet-1", "web-tier-subnet", "db-subnet"]
        replacement: "subnet-{uuid4_short}"

      security_group_names:
        patterns: ["web-sg", "database-security", "api-access-sg"]
        replacement: "sg-{uuid4_short}"

  uuid_generation_strategy:
    consistency_requirement: "Same original name always gets same UUID"
    implementation: "Hash original name to generate deterministic UUID"
    uuid_format: "First 8 characters of MD5(original_name + type_salt)"
```

#### Sensitive Data Scrubbing
```yaml
sensitive_data_scrubbing:
  domain_names:
    patterns: ["*.company.com", "api.startup.io", "*.proprietary-domain.net"]
    replacement: "domain-{uuid4_short}.example.com"
    purpose: "Remove customer-specific domains"

  ip_addresses:
    private_ip_ranges:
      - "10.0.0.0/8" → "10.x.x.x" (preserve private IP structure)
      - "172.16.0.0/12" → "172.x.x.x"
      - "192.168.0.0/16" → "192.168.x.x"

    public_ip_addresses:
      pattern: "Any non-private IP"
      replacement: "public-ip-{sequential}"
      example: "203.0.113.1" → "public-ip-001"

  organizational_terminology:
    company_specific_terms:
      detection: "Terms that appear to be company-specific"
      replacement: "generic equivalent or uuid-based term"
      examples:
        - "acme-auth-system" → "auth-system-{uuid}"
        - "widgets-r-us-api" → "product-api-{uuid}"
        - "super-secure-vault" → "secure-storage-{uuid}"

    project_code_names:
      patterns: ["project-alpha", "operation-falcon", "initiative-beta"]
      replacement: "project-{uuid4_short}"
      purpose: "Remove internal project identifiers"
```
