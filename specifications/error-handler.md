- **Multi-Step Resolution**: Provide detailed troubleshooting workflows
- **Alternative Approaches**: Offer multiple solution paths when available

### 3. Guided Troubleshooting
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Provide clear, sequential troubleshooting steps
- **Diagnostic Commands**: Suggest specific commands for problem diagnosis
- **Validation Steps**: Include verification commands after each fix attempt
- **Escalation Triggers**: Identify when to escalate to human support

### 4. Learning and Pattern Evolution
