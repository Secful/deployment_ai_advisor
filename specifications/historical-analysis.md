# Historical Session Analysis Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the historical session analysis system for leveraging past deployment sessions to improve current recommendations, assess credibility of different data sources, and identify successful deployment patterns in the Salt Security Deployment Advisor system.

## Credibility Scoring Framework

### Multi-Factor Credibility Algorithm
```yaml
credibility_scoring:
  algorithm_overview:
    purpose: "Assign credibility scores to historical sessions for recommendation weighting"
    output_range: "0.0 to 1.0 (higher = more credible)"
    minimum_threshold: "0.5 for inclusion in recommendations"

  core_factors:
    recency_factor:
      weight: 0.4
      formula: "recency_score = max(0, 1.0 - (days_since_session / 365))"
      rationale: "Recent sessions more relevant due to technology evolution"
      decay_function: "Linear decay over 365 days"

    similarity_factor:
      weight: 0.4
      formula: "similarity_score = jaccard_similarity(current_context, historical_context)"
      rationale: "Similar deployment contexts provide more relevant insights"
      context_vectors: ["cloud_provider", "service_types", "complexity_level", "architecture_pattern"]

    success_factor:
      weight: 0.2
      formula: "success_score = (completion_score * user_satisfaction) / 100"
      rationale: "Successful sessions provide more reliable patterns"
      components: ["deployment_success", "user_satisfaction", "follow_through"]

  combined_credibility:
    formula: "credibility = (recency * 0.4) + (similarity * 0.4) + (success * 0.2)"
    normalization: "Ensure score remains in [0.0, 1.0] range"
    validation: "Score must be >= 0.5 for session to influence recommendations"
```

### Recency Analysis Implementation
```yaml
recency_analysis:
  temporal_weighting:
    fresh_sessions:
      age_range: "0-30 days"
      recency_score: "0.95-1.0"
      weight_multiplier: "1.0x"
      rationale: "Current best practices and latest service features"

    recent_sessions:
      age_range: "31-90 days"
      recency_score: "0.85-0.95"
      weight_multiplier: "0.9x"
      rationale: "Still highly relevant with minor technology drift"

    moderately_aged_sessions:
      age_range: "91-180 days"
      recency_score: "0.7-0.85"
      weight_multiplier: "0.75x"
      rationale: "Relevant but some service changes may have occurred"

    older_sessions:
      age_range: "181-365 days"
      recency_score: "0.3-0.7"
      weight_multiplier: "0.5x"
      rationale: "Historical patterns still valuable but technology has evolved"

    legacy_sessions:
      age_range: ">365 days"
      recency_score: "0.0-0.3"
      weight_multiplier: "0.25x"
      rationale: "Historical context only, may not reflect current best practices"

  temporal_context_factors:
    service_evolution_tracking:
      aws_service_updates: "Track AWS service feature releases"
      azure_service_updates: "Track Azure service updates"
      gcp_service_updates: "Track Google Cloud service changes"
