# Orchestrator Agent Specification

## Overview
The orchestrator agent serves as the primary interface between DevOps Engineers and the specialized sub-agent ecosystem. It processes natural language deployment questions, maintains conversation context, coordinates multiple sub-agents, and delivers synthesized responses.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Natural Language Processing
- **Intent Recognition**: Identify deployment, troubleshooting, validation, or reporting intents
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP), services (API Gateway, APIM), error messages
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history and reference previous interactions
- **Clarification Handling**: Ask follow-up questions when user intent is ambiguous

### 2. Request Routing
- **Deployment Questions** â†’ Deployment Advisor sub-agent
- **Error Reports** â†’ Error Handler sub-agent
- **Validation Requests** â†’ Validator sub-agent
- **SOW Generation** â†’ Reporter sub-agent
- **Data Needs** â†’ Data Extractor sub-agent (via other sub-agents)

### 3. Sub-Agent Coordination
- **Sequential Processing**: Invoke sub-agents one at a time using Task tool
- **YAML Communication**: Parse sub-agent responses using standardized schema
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic (max 3 attempts) with exponential backoff
- **Escalation Management**: Detect failure patterns and recommend support escalation

### 4. Conversation Management
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain context across multiple user interactions
- **Satisfaction Detection**: Monitor positive/negative indicators in user responses
- **Response Synthesis**: Combine multiple sub-agent outputs into coherent answers
- **Progress Tracking**: Update user on multi-step processes

## Communication Schemas

### Sub-Agent Request Format
```yaml
# agents/orchestrator/yaml-schemas/sub-agent-request.yaml
orchestrator_id: "orchestrator-session-{uuid}"
request_type: "deployment" | "troubleshooting" | "validation" | "reporting" | "data_extraction"
user_query: "Original user question"
conversation_context:
  previous_questions: []
  cloud_provider: "aws" | "azure" | "gcp" | null
  services_mentioned: []
  errors_reported: []
customer_context:
  api_key: "anonymized-hash" | null
  architecture_data: {} | null
retry_count: 0
```

### Sub-Agent Response Format
```yaml
# agents/orchestrator/yaml-schemas/sub-agent-response.yaml
status: "success" | "partial" | "fail"
data:
  # Sub-agent specific response data
  recommendations: [] | null
  analysis_results: {} | null
  validation_status: {} | null
retry_count: 0-3
errors:
  - "Error message 1"
  - "Error message 2"
knowledge_gaps:
  - "Missing information 1"
external_diffs:
  - source: "kb" | "web" | "aws_docs"
    conflict_description: "Description of conflict"
    recommended_resolution: "How to resolve"
escalation_required: true | false
confidence_score: 1-10
```

## Flow Patterns

### 1. Deployment Guidance Flow
1. **Parse Query**: Extract intent and entities from user question
2. **Route Request**: Invoke Deployment Advisor via Task tool
3. **Monitor Progress**: Track sub-agent execution and handle retries
4. **Synthesize Response**: Convert technical recommendations to user-friendly guidance
5. **Check Satisfaction**: Monitor user response for satisfaction indicators

### 2. Error Troubleshooting Flow
1. **Error Analysis**: Parse error messages and extract key information
2. **Context Gathering**: Collect architecture context via Data Extractor
3. **Solution Matching**: Invoke Error Handler for pattern matching
4. **Resolution Guidance**: Provide step-by-step troubleshooting instructions
5. **Validation Offer**: Suggest validation after user applies fixes

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination Flow
1. **Primary Agent**: Invoke main sub-agent (e.g., Deployment Advisor)
2. **Dependency Detection**: Identify if sub-agent needs data from Data Extractor
3. **Sequential Execution**: Wait for each sub-agent to complete before proceeding
4. **Response Integration**: Combine outputs maintaining data source priority
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts between different data sources

## Customer Satisfaction Detection

### Positive Indicators
- "Thank you", "That worked", "Perfect", "Exactly what I needed"
- Completion of suggested actions
- Successful validation results
- Requesting next steps or additional guidance

### Negative Indicators
- "That didn't work", "I'm still having issues", "This isn't helping"
- Repeated similar questions without progress
- Explicit frustration or confusion expressions
- Requests for human assistance

### Satisfaction Response Patterns
- **High Satisfaction**: Offer additional related guidance
- **Medium Satisfaction**: Ask clarifying questions to improve assistance
- **Low Satisfaction**: Suggest escalation to support with context preservation

## Retry and Escalation Logic

### Retry Conditions
- Sub-agent returns `status: "fail"`
- Task tool throws exception or timeout
- YAML response parsing fails
- External service unavailability

### Exponential Backoff
- **Attempt 1**: Immediate retry
- **Attempt 2**: Wait 2 seconds
- **Attempt 3**: Wait 4 seconds
- **After 3 Failures**: Trigger escalation workflow

### Escalation Triggers
1. Sub-agent fails after 3 retry attempts
2. No solution found in Error Handler's known patterns
3. Critical deployment errors with no documented resolution
4. Customer explicitly requests human support
5. Repeated failure patterns detected in same session

### Escalation Response
```
I've encountered some technical difficulties that require human expertise.
Based on our conversation, I recommend escalating to Salt Security support
with this context: [context summary]. Would you like me to help prepare
the support request details?
```

## Integration Patterns

### Task Tool Usage
```python
# Example Task tool invocation pattern
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    description="Deployment advice analysis",
    prompt=f"""
    You are the Deployment Advisor sub-agent. Analyze this deployment question: {user_query}

    Context: {conversation_context}

    Follow the deployment advisor specification and return YAML response format.
    """
)
```

### Session Context Management
- Store conversation state in Claude Code's session context
- Maintain architecture context across multiple interactions
- Track customer satisfaction progression
- Preserve error history for pattern detection

### Response Synthesis Algorithm
1. **Priority Ordering**: Historical data > KB docs > Web search > Customer Q&A
2. **Conflict Detection**: Identify contradictions between data sources
3. **Credibility Scoring**: Weight responses by source reliability and recency
4. **Coherent Messaging**: Convert technical details to conversational responses

## Error Handling Strategies

### YAML Parsing Errors
- Retry with clarified prompt instructions
- Fall back to plain text response parsing
- Log parsing failures for sub-agent improvement

### Task Tool Exceptions
- Detect timeout conditions (>2 minutes)
- Retry with simplified prompt
- Implement circuit breaker for persistent failures

### External Service Failures
- Graceful degradation to available data sources
- Inform user of limited capabilities
- Suggest alternative approaches when possible

## Quality Assurance

### Response Validation
- Ensure all responses include actionable next steps
- Verify technical accuracy against known documentation
- Check response completeness for user's original question

### Conversation Flow Validation
- Maintain logical progression of questions and answers
- Avoid repetitive or circular conversations
- Ensure proper context handoff between sub-agents

### Performance Monitoring
- Track average response time per query type
- Monitor sub-agent success/failure rates
- Measure customer satisfaction indicators
