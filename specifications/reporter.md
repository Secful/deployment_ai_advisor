### 2. Session Storage Management
- **Customer-Specific Sessions**: Store complete conversation and deployment context
- **Anonymization Processing**: Create anonymized versions for learning purposes
- **Version Management**: Handle session versioning and conflict prevention
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure proper data handling and privacy compliance

### 3. Knowledge Management
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintain consistent documentation formats
- **Best Practices Documentation**: Capture and document deployment best practices
