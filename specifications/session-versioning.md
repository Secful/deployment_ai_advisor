# Session Versioning Logic Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the session versioning system for managing customer deployment sessions with semantic versioning, conflict resolution, and session continuity in the Salt Security Deployment Advisor system.

## Semantic Versioning Model

### Version Format: v{major}.{minor}.{patch}

#### Major Version Increments (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
```yaml
major_version_triggers:
  new_deployment_scenario:
    definition: "Completely different deployment scenario with same customer"
    examples:
      - cloud_provider_change: "AWS deployment → Azure deployment"
      - architecture_shift: "API Gateway → Load Balancer architecture"
      - service_type_change: "Web application → Microservices"
      - environment_change: "Development → Production deployment"

  business_context_change:
    definition: "Different business use case or project"
    examples:
      - project_switch: "Authentication service → Payment processing"
      - compliance_change: "Standard deployment → HIPAA compliant"
      - scale_shift: "Startup deployment → Enterprise deployment"

  timeline_separation:
    definition: "Significant time gap between deployments (>30 days)"
    rationale: "Assumes different deployment context and requirements"
```

#### Minor Version Increments (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)
```yaml
minor_version_triggers:

      - optimization_session: "Improving existing deployment"
      - expansion_planning: "Adding services to existing deployment"

  workflow_continuation:
    definition: "Different workflow phase for same deployment"
    examples:
      - guidance_to_troubleshooting: "Moving from advice to error resolution"
      - implementation_to_validation: "Moving from deployment to verification"
      - validation_to_optimization: "Moving from verification to improvement"

  session_repairs:
    definition: "Recovering from system errors or interruptions"
    examples:
      - incomplete_session_recovery: "Restoring interrupted session"
      - missing_file_regeneration: "Recreating missing session files"
      - conversation_reconstruction: "Rebuilding conversation from logs"

```

## Version Management Implementation

### Version Assignment Logic
```yaml
version_assignment:
  new_session_creation:
    algorithm: |
      1. Check if customer directory exists
      2. If not exists: create v1.0.0
      3. If exists: analyze latest session
      4. Determine version increment type based on:
         - Time since last session
         - Deployment scenario similarity
         - Business context analysis
      5. Assign next available version number

  version_calculation:
    major_increment_check:
      - time_gap_analysis: "Check if >30 days since last session"
      - scenario_comparison: "Compare deployment scenarios"
      - context_analysis: "Analyze business context changes"

    minor_increment_check:
      - workflow_relationship: "Check if related to existing deployment"
      - conversation_continuity: "Analyze conversation context"
      - timeline_proximity: "Check if within reasonable timeframe"

    patch_increment_check:
      - data_integrity_issues: "Check for corruption or errors"
      - administrative_needs: "Check for system-level updates"
```

### Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

#### Concurrent Session Detection
```yaml
concurrent_session_handling:
  detection_strategy:
    timestamp_precision: "Microsecond precision for session creation"
    lock_file_mechanism: "Temporary lock files during version assignment"
    atomic_directory_creation: "Use atomic operations for directory creation"

  resolution_algorithm:
    scenario_1_simultaneous_start:
      situation: "Two sessions start within same millisecond"
      resolution: |
        1. Create lock file: /sessions/{customer_id}/.version_lock
        2. First process to create lock gets priority
        3. Second process waits up to 5 seconds for lock release
        4. Assign versions based on lock acquisition order

    scenario_2_version_collision:
      situation: "Calculated version already exists"
      resolution: |
        1. Increment to next available version
        2. Log collision event for analysis
        3. Update version assignment algorithm if pattern detected

    scenario_3_interrupted_creation:
      situation: "Session creation interrupted mid-process"
      resolution: |
        1. Detect incomplete session directories
        2. Clean up incomplete sessions older than 1 hour
        3. Retry version assignment with cleanup
```

#### Version Collision Handling
```yaml
collision_resolution:
  detection_methods:
    directory_existence_check: "Check if version directory already exists"
    metadata_file_validation: "Verify existing session is valid"
    lock_file_detection: "Check for active session creation locks"

  resolution_strategies:
    increment_and_retry:
      algorithm: |
        1. If v1.1.0 exists, try v1.1.1
        2. If v1.1.1 exists, try v1.1.2
        3. Continue until available version found
        4. Maximum 100 attempts before error

    timestamp_disambiguation:
      algorithm: |
        1. Compare session creation timestamps
        2. Earlier session keeps lower version
        3. Later session gets next available version
        4. Update session metadata with resolution note

    merge_requirement_detection:
      criteria:
        - same_deployment_scenario: "Sessions targeting same deployment"
        - overlapping_timeframes: "Sessions with overlapping active periods"
        - related_conversations: "Sessions with related conversation topics"

      resolution: "Flag for manual review and potential merge"
```

### Session Continuity Management

#### Cross-Version Context Preservation
```yaml
context_preservation:
  version_relationship_tracking:
    parent_session_reference:
      field: "previous_session_version"
      purpose: "Track session lineage"
      example: "v1.2.0 references v1.1.0 as parent"

    session_family_identification:
      field: "session_family_id"
      purpose: "Group related sessions across versions"
      format: "deployment-{hash}-family"

    context_inheritance:
      inherited_elements:
        - deployment_context: "Previous deployment decisions"
        - user_expertise_level: "Learned user expertise level"
        - preferred_cloud_provider: "User's preferred cloud platform"
        - conversation_style: "User's interaction preferences"

  continuity_mechanisms:
    context_loading:
      process: |
        1. Load current session version
        2. Identify parent sessions (same family)
        3. Load relevant context from parent sessions
        4. Merge context with current session data
        5. Prioritize recent context over older data

    decision_continuity:
      process: |
        1. Extract key decisions from previous sessions
        2. Check if decisions are still relevant
        3. Apply consistent decision logic across sessions
        4. Flag any conflicting decisions for review
```

#### Session Timeline Management
```yaml
timeline_management:
  session_chronology:
    temporal_ordering:
      - created_timestamp: "Initial session creation time"
      - last_activity_timestamp: "Most recent session activity"
