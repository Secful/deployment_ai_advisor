# Deployment Advisor Agent Specification

## Overview
The deployment-advisor agent serves as the subject matter expert for Salt Security collector deployment planning. It analyzes customer cloud architectures, consults deployment flowcharts, and generates specific deployment recommendations with implementation guidance.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Architecture Analysis
- **Cloud Asset Assessment**: Analyze customer cloud assets via Data Extractor
- **Service Pattern Recognition**: Identify API Gateway, Load Balancer, and service patterns
- **Complexity Evaluation**: Score deployment complexity (1-10 scale)
- **Traffic Volume Estimation**: Assess traffic patterns for collector sizing

### 2. Flowchart Consultation
- **Decision Tree Navigation**: Consult appropriate flowcharts based on cloud provider and service type
- **Context Application**: Apply customer-specific context to flowchart decision points
- **Path Optimization**: Select optimal deployment path based on user expertise and requirements
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify recommendations across multiple flowcharts

### 3. Recommendation Generation
- **Collector Selection**: Choose specific collector type and configuration
- **Prerequisites Identification**: List all required permissions, services, and configurations
- **Implementation Planning**: Generate step-by-step deployment instructions
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential deployment issues and mitigation strategies

### 4. Interactive Guidance
- **Clarifying Questions**: Ask follow-up questions when requirements are unclear
- **Option Presentation**: Present multiple deployment options with trade-offs
- **Expertise Matching**: Tailor recommendations to user skill level
- **Iterative Refinement**: Refine recommendations based on user feedback

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Deployment Recommendation

#### Phase 1: Context Assessment
1. **Parse User Query**: Extract intent, cloud provider, services mentioned
2. **Request Architecture Data**: Invoke Data Extractor for cloud assets
3. **Assess User Expertise**: Evaluate complexity tolerance based on conversation
4. **Identify Constraints**: Extract budget, compliance, or timing constraints

#### Phase 2: Flowchart Consultation
1. **Select Primary Flowchart**: Choose appropriate decision tree (AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. **Navigate Decision Path**: Apply customer context to decision points
3. **Extract Recommendations**: Gather collector options and requirements
4. **Cross-Validate**: Check recommendations against validation flowchart

#### Phase 3: Recommendation Synthesis
1. **Rank Options**: Score options by success probability and complexity
2. **Generate Implementation Plan**: Create detailed deployment steps
3. **Assess Risks**: Identify potential issues and mitigations
4. **Package Response**: Format recommendation with supporting details

## Flowchart Integration Patterns

### AWS API Gateway Integration
```yaml
aws_integration:
  consultation_trigger:
    user_mentions: ["aws", "api gateway", "lambda", "rest api"]
    architecture_data: contains_aws_api_gateway

  flowchart_consultation:
    primary_flowchart: "agents/flowcharts/aws-api-gateway-flow.md"
    consultation_interface: "agents/flowcharts/flowchart-consultation-interface.md"

  context_mapping:
    api_gateway_type: extract_from_architecture_data
    integration_type: infer_from_backend_services
    traffic_volume: extract_or_request_from_user
    vpc_configuration: check_architecture_data

  recommendation_processing:
    collector_selection: map_flowchart_output_to_collector_type
    complexity_assessment: calculate_based_on_prerequisites
    implementation_steps: generate_from_flowchart_recommendations
```

### Multi-Cloud Scenario Handling
```yaml
multi_cloud_approach:
  detection:
    indicators: ["multiple cloud providers in architecture_data", "user mentions multiple clouds"]

  strategy:
    decomposition: "Separate recommendations by cloud provider"
    integration_planning: "Plan cross-cloud monitoring strategy"
    phased_deployment: "Recommend deployment order by complexity"

  coordination:
    with_data_extractor: "Request cloud-specific asset details"
    with_validator: "Plan cross-cloud validation strategy"
    with_reporter: "Create comprehensive multi-cloud SOW"
```

## Quality Assurance and Confidence Scoring

### Confidence Level Calculation
```yaml
confidence_calculation:
  high_confidence: 8-10
    conditions:
      - complete_architecture_data: true
      - standard_deployment_pattern: true
      - clear_user_requirements: true
      - proven_success_history: true

  medium_confidence: 5-7
    conditions:
      - partial_architecture_data: true
      - some_assumptions_made: true
      - minor_gaps_in_requirements: true

  low_confidence: 1-4
    conditions:
      - minimal_architecture_data: true
      - significant_assumptions_made: true
      - complex_custom_requirements: true
      - limited_historical_success_data: true
```

### Success Probability Assessment
```yaml
success_probability_factors:
  user_expertise_match:
    beginner_simple: 95%
    beginner_complex: 60%
    expert_simple: 98%
    expert_complex: 85%

  architecture_complexity:
    single_service_standard: +10%
    multi_service_integrated: -15%
    custom_configurations: -20%

  prerequisite_completeness:
    all_prerequisites_met: +15%
    some_prerequisites_missing: -10%
    major_prerequisites_missing: -25%

  historical_success_rates:
    similar_deployments: use_historical_average
    new_pattern: apply_conservative_estimate
```

## Error Handling and Escalation

### Common Issues and Responses

#### Issue: Insufficient Architecture Data
**Detection**: architecture_data is null or incomplete
**Response**:
1. Request specific cloud asset data from Data Extractor
2. Ask user for missing critical information
3. Provide general recommendations with caveats
4. Set confidence level to "low" and explain limitations

#### Issue: Conflicting Requirements
**Detection**: User requirements contradict each other or best practices
**Response**:
1. Clearly identify the conflicts
2. Explain trade-offs for each option
3. Ask user to prioritize requirements
4. Provide multiple options addressing different priorities

#### Issue: Unsupported Architecture Pattern
**Detection**: Architecture doesn't match any known flowchart patterns
**Response**:
1. Acknowledge the custom architecture
2. Provide closest matching recommendations with modifications
3. Clearly state assumptions and limitations
4. Escalate to human expert if complexity is too high

### Escalation Criteria
```yaml
escalation_triggers:
  technical_complexity:
    - custom_protocols: "Non-standard API protocols"
    - security_requirements: "Complex compliance requirements"
    - scale_requirements: "Extremely high traffic volumes"

  confidence_thresholds:
    - confidence_score: < 4
    - success_probability: < 60%
    - multiple_failed_attempts: > 2

  knowledge_gaps:
    - unsupported_services: "Services not covered in flowcharts"
    - emerging_technologies: "New cloud services without proven patterns"
    - integration_complexity: "Complex cross-service integrations"
```
