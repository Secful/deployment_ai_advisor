# Session Storage Management Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the session storage management system for real-time conversation tracking, version management, and anonymized learning data collection in the Salt Security Deployment Advisor system.

## Core Components

      confidence: "0.0-1.0 confidence score"
      reasoning: "explanation of decision logic"
```

### Storage Implementation Patterns

#### Real-Time Storage (Task 5.3)
```yaml
real_time_implementation:
  storage_triggers:
    conversation_turn_completion:
      event: "User query processed and response generated"
      action: "Write conversation turn to conversation.json"
      timing: "Immediate upon response completion"

    decision_point_reached:
      event: "Agent makes deployment or architecture decision"
      action: "Update deployment_context.json with decision"
      timing: "Immediately when decision is made"

    error_occurrence:
      event: "Error encountered during processing"
      action: "Log error to deployment_context.json error_resolutions"
      timing: "Immediately when error is detected"

    session_metadata_change:
      event: "Session status or workflow phase changes"
      action: "Update session_metadata.json"
      timing: "Immediately when status changes"

  storage_operations:
    atomic_writes:
      pattern: "Write to temporary file, then atomic rename"
      purpose: "Prevent corruption during concurrent access"
      implementation: "Use .tmp extension, then rename"

    incremental_updates:
      pattern: "Load existing, modify, write complete file"
      purpose: "Maintain complete session state"
      optimization: "Only write if changes detected"

    concurrent_access:
      pattern: "File locking during write operations"
      purpose: "Prevent corruption from concurrent writes"
      implementation: "Use platform-specific file locking"
```

#### Version Management (Task 5.4)
```yaml
version_management:
  versioning_rules:
    major_increment: "v1.0.0 → v2.0.0"
      trigger: "New deployment scenario with same customer"
      examples: ["Different cloud provider", "New application architecture"]

    minor_increment: "v1.0.0 → v1.1.0"
      trigger: "Follow-up conversation on same deployment"
      examples: ["Troubleshooting session", "Validation follow-up"]

    patch_increment: "v1.0.0 → v1.0.1"
      trigger: "Data correction or session repair"
      examples: ["Fix corrupted data", "Update session metadata"]

  conflict_resolution:
    concurrent_session_detection:
      scenario: "Two sessions starting simultaneously for same customer"
      resolution: "Timestamp-based ordering with millisecond precision"
      implementation: "Earlier timestamp gets lower version number"

    version_collision_handling:
      scenario: "Version already exists when creating new session"
      resolution: "Increment to next available version"
      example: "v1.1.0 exists, create v1.1.1 instead"

    session_merge_requirements:
      scenario: "Related sessions need to be combined"
      resolution: "Manual review required"
      process: "Flag for human operator review"
```

#### Anonymized Learning Sessions (Task 5.5)
```yaml
anonymized_sessions:
  anonymization_process:
    customer_id_handling:
      original: "customer-xyz789"
      anonymized: "customer-{md5_hash}"
      purpose: "Enable learning while protecting identity"

    resource_name_anonymization:
      pattern: "Replace specific names with UUIDs"

      purpose: "Similar architectures provide more relevant insights"
      tag_categories: ["cloud_provider", "service_types", "complexity_level"]

    success_outcome:
      formula: "success_score = session_success_score / 10"
      purpose: "Successful sessions are more credible references"
      success_indicators: ["completion_status", "user_satisfaction", "deployment_success"]

    combined_credibility:
      formula: "credibility = (recency * 0.4) + (similarity * 0.4) + (success * 0.2)"
      range: "0.0 to 1.0"
      threshold: "0.5 minimum for inclusion in recommendations"

## Implementation Guidelines

### File System Operations
```yaml
file_operations:
  directory_creation:
    pattern: "/sessions/{api_key}/{version}/"
    timing: "Created on first interaction with customer"
    permissions: "Restricted to system user only"

  atomic_file_writes:
    pattern: "Write to .tmp file, then rename"
    purpose: "Prevent corruption during concurrent access"
    implementation: |
      1. Write complete content to {filename}.tmp
      2. Atomic rename to {filename}
      3. Delete .tmp file if rename fails

  concurrent_access_handling:
    strategy: "File-based locking with timeout"
    timeout: "5 seconds maximum wait"
    fallback: "Log warning and proceed with best effort"
```
