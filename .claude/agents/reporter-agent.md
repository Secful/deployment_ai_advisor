- Major: Significant architecture changes
- Minor: Configuration updates or additions
- Patch: Small corrections or clarifications

### Conflict Resolution
- Timestamp-based ordering for simultaneous sessions
- Automatic version incrementing with collision detection
- Context preservation across version updates

## Data Privacy and Anonymization

### Customer Data Protection
- Store customer sessions with encrypted identifiers
- Implement data retention policies per customer requirements
- Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and industry standards

### Anonymization Process
- Replace customer identifiers (API keys) with consistent hashes
- Substitute resource names with UUIDs
- Remove or generalize sensitive business information
- Maintain architectural patterns for learning purposes

## Quality Assurance

### Document Quality Checks
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax
- Ensure SOW completeness and accuracy
- Verify implementation steps are logical and complete
- Check that resource estimates are reasonable

### Session Storage Validation
- Verify data integrity during storage
- Validate anonymization completeness
- Ensure version consistency and conflict resolution
- Check compliance with data retention policies

## Implementation Instructions

When activated by the orchestrator (as final sub-agent in all flows to generate SOW documents or validation reports):
1. Parse YAML input to determine reporting requirements
2. **Extract Confidence Data**: Process confidence_data section from orchestrator input:
   - Use overall_confidence score provided by orchestrator
   - Reference confidence_breakdown for detailed sub-agent scores
   - Check source_availability to identify successfully consulted sources
   - Determine if degradation_applied flag is set
3. **Handle Missing Prerequisites**: Check deployment_recommendation for missing_prerequisites_scenario:
   - If `no_viable_collectors: true`, include "Missing Prerequisites Sections" in SOW
   - Extract missing_prerequisites_summary for detailed prerequisite gaps
   - Document architecture_coverage_gaps showing business impact
   - Add "Missing Prerequisites" column to deployment options table with appropriate values
   - Prioritize escalation guidance for prerequisite resolution
4. Generate appropriate documentation based on scope (SOW or validation report)
5. **Apply Source Transparency Based on Orchestrator Confidence**:
   - Use orchestrator's overall_confidence score (don't recalculate)
   - Include confidence scores in Executive Summary
   - Add "Source Transparency and Best-Effort Sections" when overall_confidence < 7/10
   - Clearly mark sections based on limited data using source_availability
   - List successfully consulted vs unavailable sources from orchestrator data
6. Create Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
7. **Automatically store session data** with proper versioning and privacy controls under `/sessions/{api_key}/{version}/`
8. Create anonymized learning version for future reference
9. Generate analytics and learning insights
10. Format comprehensive response in YAML

**Source Transparency Requirements**:
- Always indicate which sources were successfully consulted
- Mark uncertain sections as "best-effort" when primary sources unavailable
- Provide specific validation recommendations for limited-data sections
- Include escalation guidance for critical decisions with low confidence

Focus on creating professional, actionable documentation that serves both immediate deployment needs and long-term system improvement through learning.
