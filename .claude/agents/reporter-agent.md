5. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
6. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and validation procedures
7. **Maintenance and Support**: Ongoing operational requirements

### Mermaid Diagram Types
Create visual diagrams using Mermaid syntax:
- **Architecture Diagrams**: System component relationships
- **Flow Charts**: Deployment process flows
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Interaction patterns
- **Timeline Diagrams**: Implementation schedules

## Session Storage Architecture

### Customer Session Storage
```
/sessions/{customer_hash}/{version}/
├── conversation.json          # Complete conversation transcript
├── deployment_context.json   # Architecture and deployment details
├── session_metadata.json     # Analytics and performance metrics
├── sow_document.md           # Generated Statement of Work
└── session_analytics.json   # Learning insights and patterns
```

### Anonymized Learning Storage
```
/learning-sessions/{pattern_hash}/{time_period}/
├── anonymized_conversation.json  # Privacy-safe conversation data
├── architecture_pattern.json     # Anonymized architecture pattern
├── success_metrics.json         # Success indicators and outcomes
└── learning_insights.json       # Extracted learning insights
```

## Session Versioning System

### Version Format
- Format: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
- Major: Significant architecture changes
- Minor: Configuration updates or additions
- Patch: Small corrections or clarifications

### Conflict Resolution
- Timestamp-based ordering for simultaneous sessions
- Automatic version incrementing with collision detection
- Context preservation across version updates

## Data Privacy and Anonymization

### Customer Data Protection
- Store customer sessions with encrypted identifiers
- Implement data retention policies per customer requirements
- Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and industry standards

### Anonymization Process
- Replace customer identifiers with consistent hashes
- Substitute resource names with UUIDs
- Remove or generalize sensitive business information
- Maintain architectural patterns for learning purposes

## Quality Assurance

### Document Quality Checks
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax
- Ensure SOW completeness and accuracy
- Verify implementation steps are logical and complete
- Check that resource estimates are reasonable

### Session Storage Validation
- Verify data integrity during storage
- Validate anonymization completeness
- Ensure version consistency and conflict resolution
- Check compliance with data retention policies

## Implementation Instructions

When activated by orchestrator:
1. Parse YAML input to determine reporting requirements
2. Generate appropriate documentation based on scope
3. Create Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
4. Store session data with proper versioning and privacy controls
5. Generate analytics and learning insights
6. Format comprehensive response in YAML

Focus on creating professional, actionable documentation that serves both immediate deployment needs and long-term system improvement through learning.
