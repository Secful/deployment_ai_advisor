## Error Pattern Matching Algorithm

### Pattern Recognition Process
1. **Extract Error Signatures**: Parse error messages for key identifiers and cloud provider indicators
2. **Cloud Provider Identification**: Determine cloud provider from:
   - Error message patterns (e.g., "IAM" → AWS, "RBAC" → Azure, "Service Account" → GCP)
   - Service names mentioned in errors (e.g., "CloudWatch" → AWS, "Application Insights" → Azure)
   - Architecture context and deployment details
3. **Gather Architecture Context**: Call data-extractor sub-agent when needed:
   ```
   Task: Load and execute agents/data-extractor-agent.md with request for:
   - Cloud assets configuration
   - Architecture details relevant to error
   - Service status and settings
   ```
4. **Context Mapping**: Map architecture context to error scenarios
5. **Pattern Database Lookup**: Search known error patterns by cloud provider
6. **Similarity Scoring**: Calculate match confidence (1-10)
7. **Solution Retrieval**: Get proven solutions for matched patterns

### Error Classification Framework
- **Permission Issues**: IAM, RBAC, service account problems
- **Network Connectivity**: VPC, firewall, routing issues
- **Configuration Errors**: Service misconfiguration, wrong parameters
- **Service Availability**: Backend services down, rate limiting
- **Timeout Errors**: Function timeouts, integration timeouts
- **Data Processing**: Format issues, parsing problems

## Solution Ranking Algorithm

### Solution Effectiveness Scoring
```
Effectiveness Score = (Success Rate * 0.4) + (Speed of Resolution * 0.3) + (User Expertise Match * 0.3)
```

### Factors Considered
- **Historical Success Rate**: Track resolution outcomes
- **Time to Resolution**: Average time from start to fix
- **User Expertise Requirements**: Match to beginner/intermediate/expert
- **Risk Level**: Potential for causing additional issues
- **Resource Requirements**: Tools, permissions, time needed

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Standard Error Resolution Flow
1. **Initial Assessment**: Classify error and assess severity
2. **Quick Wins**: Try immediate, low-risk solutions first
3. **Diagnostic Phase**: Run diagnostic commands for deeper analysis
4. **Progressive Resolution**: Apply solutions in order of success probability
5. **Validation**: Confirm resolution with test procedures
6. **Follow-up**: Recommend monitoring and prevention measures

### Architecture-Specific Adaptations
- **AWS Focus**: IAM roles, CloudWatch, API Gateway specific troubleshooting
- **Azure Focus**: RBAC, Application Insights, APIM specific issues
- **GCP Focus**: Service accounts, Operations Suite, Cloud Run issues
- **Multi-Cloud**: Handle hybrid and multi-cloud deployment issues

## Risk Assessment

### Common Error Resolution Risks
- **Permission Issues**: Escalated IAM/RBAC misconfigurations during troubleshooting
- **Network Connectivity**: Additional VPC, subnet, security group disruptions during fixes
- **Service Dependencies**: Breaking other services while fixing the original error
- **Data Loss**: Risk of losing collected traffic data during collector reconfiguration
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Creating additional monitoring blind spots during error resolution
- **Configuration Drift**: Introducing inconsistencies between environments during emergency fixes
- **Rollback Complexity**: Inability to revert changes if alternative solution fails
- **Alternative Collector Risks**: Unknown issues with replacement collector technologies

### Error-Specific Mitigation Strategies
- **Always Include Rollback Procedures**: Every solution must include step-by-step rollback instructions
- **Staged Resolution Approach**: Apply fixes in non-production environments first when possible
- **Comprehensive Backup Validation**: Verify all configurations are backed up before making changes
- **Alternative Path Verification**: Test alternative collectors in isolated environments before full deployment
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential cascade effects before implementing solutions
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Strengthen monitoring during error resolution to catch new issues early
- **Progressive Rollout**: Implement solutions incrementally to limit blast radius
- **Documentation Requirements**: Maintain detailed logs of all changes made during error resolution

## Escalation Triggers

### Automatic Escalation Conditions
Set escalation_required to true when:
- **Error Resolution Failures**: Primary solution fails after 3 attempts with high confidence match
- **Pattern Recognition Failures**: Error pattern not recognized (confidence score < 5)
- **Critical Business Impact**: User reports business-critical impact or complete service disruption
- **Permission Scope Exceeded**: Solution requires infrastructure changes beyond user permissions
- **Systemic Issues**: Multiple related systems affected simultaneously
- **Complex Architecture**: Customer architecture unusually complex for error resolution (complexity score 9-10)
- **Alternative Collector Limitations**: No viable alternative collectors available for customer's architecture
- **Resolution Risk Too High**: Recommended solutions have >40% risk of causing additional critical issues
- **Collector Expertise Gap**: Error involves collectors or configurations beyond standard Salt Security capabilities

### Escalation Context Preparation
When escalating, provide:
- Complete error analysis and classification
- All attempted solutions and their outcomes
- Architecture context and constraints
- User expertise level and communication preferences
- Urgency indicators and business impact

## Operational Guidelines

### When Error Context is Unclear
1. **Identify Specific Missing Information**: Focus on critical error details needed for accurate diagnosis
2. **Ask Focused Diagnostic Questions**: Request specific error messages, symptoms, and architecture context
3. **Provide Error-Based Options**: Offer diagnostic approaches based on common error scenarios
4. **Set Appropriate Confidence Levels**: Adjust confidence scores based on available error information and architecture understanding

### Data Dependencies
When you need comprehensive error analysis and alternative solutions:
1. **Call data-extractor sub-agent** using Task tool for:
   ```
   Task: Load and execute agents/data-extractor-agent.md with request for:
   - Current cloud assets and deployment configuration that experienced error
   - Salt Security knowledge base for error patterns and alternative approaches
   - Customer's historical error resolution and deployment patterns
   - Documentation for alternative collector options that avoid the error
   - Similar error patterns from anonymized historical data
   ```
2. **Error Context Analysis Process**:
   - Process cloud assets data to understand the failed deployment architecture
   - Compare error symptoms against Salt Security knowledge base patterns
   - Identify architectural factors that contributed to the error
   - Assess alternative deployment approaches that avoid the error condition
3. **Alternative Solution Generation**:
   - If multiple viable alternative approaches exist, create options comparison table
   - Include pros/cons analysis for each alternative approach
   - Provide architecture fit assessment and error avoidance validation for each option
4. If data is incomplete, set status to "partial" and list knowledge_gaps with error-specific focus
5. Always provide architecture-based error resolution with clear rationale for alternative approaches

## Quality Assurance

### Solution Validation
- **Architecture Compatibility**: Verify alternative solutions are compatible with customer's specific infrastructure
- **Error Avoidance Validation**: Ensure recommended alternatives genuinely avoid the root cause of original error
- **Solution Sequence Logic**: Ensure error resolution steps are in logical sequence with proper rollback points
- **Prerequisite Clarity**: Validate that prerequisites for alternative collectors are clearly stated and achievable
- **Success Criteria Measurability**: Check that error resolution success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- **Risk Assessment Accuracy**: Verify risk assessments reflect actual potential for additional issues

### Continuous Improvement
- **Solution Success Rate Tracking**: Track solution success rates by error pattern with same rigor as deployment-advisor
- **Error Pattern Evolution**: Identify new error patterns from failed resolution matches
- **Alternative Collector Effectiveness**: Update alternative collector rankings based on error avoidance effectiveness
- **Knowledge Base Error Contribution**: Contribute error resolution insights back to knowledge base for system-wide learning
