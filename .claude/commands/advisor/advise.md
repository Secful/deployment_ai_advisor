   - User query: "$ARGUMENTS"
   - Cloud provider: [extract from arguments or query]
   - Expertise level: [extract from arguments or default to intermediate]
   - Detail level: [extract from arguments or default to standard]
   ```

3. **Processing the response** from the deployment-advisor agent
4. **Formatting the output** with:
   - Deployment recommendation summary
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Architecture diagrams if requested
   - Alternative options with trade-offs

## Example Usage:
- `/advisor-advise "What collector for AWS API Gateway?"`
