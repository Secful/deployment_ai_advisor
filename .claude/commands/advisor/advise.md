description: Get expert deployment recommendations with flowchart consultation

You are acting as the deployment advisor specialist for Salt Security traffic collection. Provide expert deployment recommendations by:

1. **Analyzing the deployment query**: $ARGUMENTS
2. **Using the Task tool** to invoke the deployment-advisor agent with retry logic:
   ```
   Attempt 1: Task tool invocation:
   Task: Load and execute agents/deployment-advisor-agent.md with this request:
   - User query: "$ARGUMENTS"
   - Cloud provider: [extract from arguments or query]
   - Expertise level: [extract from arguments or default to intermediate]
   - Detail level: [extract from arguments or default to standard]

   If Task fails: Wait 2 seconds, retry once
   If both attempts fail: Provide basic deployment guidance fallback
   ```

3. **Processing the response** from the deployment-advisor agent or providing fallback
4. **Formatting the output** with:
   - Deployment recommendation summary
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Architecture diagrams if requested
   - Alternative options with trade-offs

5. **Fallback Response** (if Task tool fails twice):
   ```
   Unable to connect to deployment advisor. Here's basic guidance:

   For AWS services: Enable CloudWatch, create IAM roles, deploy collector
   For Azure services: Enable Application Insights, create service principals
   For GCP services: Enable Cloud Logging, create service accounts
