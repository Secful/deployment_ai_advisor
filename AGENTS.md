# AI Agent Repository Context

‚úÖ **TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE**: This file now reflects the **SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION** after converting 65,459 bytes of specification theater into 6 working agents using KISS principles.

## üîß Repository Overview
- [ai-docs/README.md](ai-docs/README.md) - Traffic Collection Deployment AI Agent system specifications for Salt Security customers
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/README.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/README.md) - MCP server with 2 working tools, Salt Security API integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
- [ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Multi-agent orchestrator system specifications with 5 sub-agents
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - MCP server architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- [ai-docs/SCHEMA.md](ai-docs/SCHEMA.md) - External data schemas for Salt Security Cloud Assets API

## üîå Interfaces
- [ai-docs/API.md](ai-docs/API.md) - /advisor: command family specifications with Claude Code CLI integration
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/API.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/API.md) - 2 working MCP tools: list_cloud_assets & get_cloud_asset (tested with CLI)

## üß™ Development Practices
- [ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) - Multi-agent development patterns, orchestrator implementation guidelines
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) - TypeScript 5.9.2, Node.js 18+, MCP SDK development
- [ai-docs/TESTING.md](ai-docs/TESTING.md) - Agent testing strategies and validation approaches

## üü¢ Implementation Status: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **‚úÖ MCP Data Layer**: Production-ready Salt API MCP server (TypeScript 5.9.2 + Node.js 18+, 2 working tools)
- **‚úÖ Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: 6 working agents with simple, practical business logic implementations
- **‚úÖ Claude Code Slash Commands**: 3 command files successfully delegate to functional agents
- **‚úÖ Simple Decision Logic**: Keyword-based routing and pattern matching algorithms implemented
- **‚úÖ Session Management**: File-based storage with JSON metadata and timestamp versioning
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Pattern matching database with cloud-specific troubleshooting solutions

## üéØ Agent System Components - **WORKING IMPLEMENTATIONS**
- **`.claude/agents/`**: 6 functional agent files with working business logic
  - **‚úÖ orchestrator-agent.md**: 62 lines of keyword-based routing with working intent detection
  - **‚úÖ deployment-advisor-agent.md**: 88 lines with collector selection algorithm and cloud-specific steps
  - **‚úÖ data-extractor-agent.md**: 155 lines with MCP integration and complexity scoring logic
  - **‚úÖ error-handler-agent.md**: 94 lines with pattern matching database and solution commands
  - **‚úÖ validator-agent.md**: 130 lines with component checking and connectivity validation
  - **‚úÖ reporter-agent.md**: 169 lines with SOW template engine and session storage
- **`.claude/commands/advisor/`**: 3 command files successfully delegate to working agents
- **`specifications/`**: Archived theoretical documents (no longer used by working system)

## ‚úÖ **TRANSFORMATION SUCCESS**
**Before**: 65,459 bytes of specification theater
**After**: 6 working agents with practical implementations
**Functional Value**: Complete - users get actual deployment advice, error solutions, and validation reports

**BOTTOM LINE**: The system is **fully functional** - practical implementations that provide real business value to Salt Security customers.
