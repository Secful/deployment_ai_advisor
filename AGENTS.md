- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/README.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/README.md) - MCP server with 2 working tools, Salt Security API integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
- [ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Multi-agent orchestrator system specifications with 5 sub-agents
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - MCP server architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- [ai-docs/SCHEMA.md](ai-docs/SCHEMA.md) - External data schemas for Salt Security Cloud Assets API

## üîå Interfaces
- [ai-docs/API.md](ai-docs/API.md) - /advisor: command family specifications with Claude Code CLI integration
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/API.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/API.md) - 2 working MCP tools: list_cloud_assets & get_cloud_asset (tested with CLI)

## üß™ Development Practices
- [ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) - Multi-agent development patterns, orchestrator implementation guidelines
- [salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](salt-api-mcp/ai-docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) - TypeScript 5.9.2, Node.js 18+, MCP SDK development
- [ai-docs/TESTING.md](ai-docs/TESTING.md) - Agent testing strategies and validation approaches
