# Traffic Collection Deployment AI Agent

## Overview
AI assistant system for Salt Security customers to deploy, troubleshoot, and manage traffic collection across cloud environments through Claude Code CLI interactions.

## âœ… **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS** âœ…

**SUCCESS**: The system has been successfully transformed from **specification theater** into **working functionality** using KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) principles.

## Working Components
- **Claude Code Agent Structure**: 6 functional agents with simple, working implementations
- **Salt API MCP Integration**: Production-ready MCP server with 2 functional tools (list_cloud_assets, get_cloud_asset)
- **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: Keyword-based routing system that actually works
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete deployment, troubleshooting, validation, and reporting workflows

## Key Features Implemented
- **âœ… Deployment Guidance**: Enhanced collector selection with flowchart consultation and complexity scoring
- **âœ… Error Troubleshooting**: Pattern matching database with working solution commands and comprehensive retry logic
- **âœ… Cloud Asset Analysis**: MCP integration with circuit breaker pattern and complexity scoring
- **âœ… SOW Generation**: Template engine with anonymized learning and session storage
- **âœ… Deployment Validation**: Component checking with connectivity tests and comprehensive reporting
- **âœ… Session Storage**: Complete anonymized learning system with privacy-compliant data collection
- **âœ… Flowchart Integration**: Decision trees consulted via Read tool for enhanced recommendations
- **âœ… Robust Error Handling**: YAML status codes, retry logic, escalation, and graceful degradation
- **âœ… Knowledge Gap Detection**: Real-time gap identification with reporting and improvement recommendations
- **âœ… UUID Anonymization**: Multi-layer anonymization with resource name sanitization

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All agents transformed from bloated specifications to working implementations:

1. **âœ… MCP Data Layer**: Production-ready salt-api-mcp server (TypeScript 5.9.2 + Node.js 18+)
2. **âœ… Agent Framework**: 6 working agents with simple, practical business logic
3. **âœ… CLI Commands**: 3 command files that delegate to functional agents
4. **âœ… Decision Logic**: Working keyword-based routing and collector selection algorithms
5. **âœ… Session Management**: File I/O with timestamp-based versioning implemented
6. **âœ… Error Handling**: Pattern matching with cloud-specific troubleshooting commands

## Claude Code Slash Commands (FUNCTIONAL)
All commands now delegate to working agents:

### Working Command Implementation
- **`/advisor:advise`** - âœ… Routes to deployment-advisor with collector recommendations
- **`/advisor:troubleshoot`** - âœ… Routes to error-handler with pattern matching solutions
- **`/advisor:validate`** - âœ… Routes to validator with component checking and reports

### What Actually Happens
1. User runs command (e.g., `/advisor:advise "AWS help"`)
2. Command file invokes Task tool to call orchestrator agent
3. **âœ… Enhanced Orchestrator Processing**:
   - Intent recognition with keyword-based classification
   - Cloud provider detection (AWS/Azure/GCP)
   - Multi-agent coordination when needed
   - Response synthesis for complex queries
   - Real-time satisfaction monitoring
   - Error recovery with classification-based retry
4. Sub-agent applies working business logic (collector selection, error matching, etc.)
5. **Result**: Comprehensive, synthesized guidance with adaptive responses based on user satisfaction

## Technology Stack

**Core Infrastructure:**
- âœ… Claude Code CLI with multi-agent framework
- âœ… MCP (Model Context Protocol) - salt-api-mcp server (TypeScript 5.9.2 + Node.js 18+)
- âœ… Salt Security Cloud Assets API integration (2 working tools: list_cloud_assets, get_cloud_asset)
- âœ… Bearer token authentication via environment variables

**Functional Agent System:**
- âœ… Multi-agent orchestrator with keyword-based routing
- âœ… Simple data structures (eliminated over-engineered YAML schemas)
- âœ… File-based session storage with JSON metadata
- âœ… Working business logic in all 6 agents

**Implemented Core Components:**
- âœ… Collector selection algorithm (service detection + cloud-specific setup)
- âœ… Error pattern matching database (classification + solution commands)
- âœ… SOW template engine (Markdown generation with Mermaid diagrams)
- âœ… Cloud asset analysis logic (complexity scoring + architecture patterns)
- âœ… Validation engine (component checking + connectivity tests)
- âœ… Session persistence layer (timestamp-based versioning + metadata tracking)
