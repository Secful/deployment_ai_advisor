  kpi_scores:
    full_coverage: 8/10      # Captures 90% of API traffic
    lower_risk: 9/10         # 94% success rate historically
    lower_effort: 7/10       # 4-6 hours implementation
    cost_efficiency: 8/10    # Moderate resource requirements
  overall_kpi_score: 8.0/10

deployment_option_2:
  name: "Enhanced Monitoring Deployment"
  kpi_scores:
    full_coverage: 10/10     # Captures 100% of traffic
    lower_risk: 7/10         # 87% success rate (newer approach)
    lower_effort: 5/10       # 8-12 hours implementation
    cost_efficiency: 6/10    # Higher resource requirements
