## Notes
- This is a Claude Code Agent System (not traditional program code) delivered as portable .md specification files
- Each agent follows standardized structure: name, description, tools, flows, and YAML communication schema
- Sequential sub-agent processing through Task tool invocation (no parallel execution)
- Session storage uses direct file writes to `/sessions/[customer_id]/[version]/` during conversations
- YAML communication format standardized across all sub-agents with retry logic and escalation handling
- Agent specifications define behavior first, then implementation follows the specification requirements
- All sub-agent communication must use the standardized YAML schema with status, data, errors, and retry_count fields
- MCP integration is centralized through data-extractor agent with exclusive Document360 access control

## TDD Planning Guidelines
When generating tasks, follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where feasible:
- **Agent Specification Testing:** Create agent specification files that define behavior, then implement agent logic
- **YAML Schema Validation:** Define YAML communication schemas, then implement validation logic
- **Command Processing:** Define command specifications, then implement command handlers
- **Flow Testing:** Create flowchart decision trees, then implement consultation logic
- **Session Management:** Define session storage schemas, then implement storage handlers

## 📊 **TASK LIST REALITY UPDATE**

### **Previous Status (Incorrect)**: [X] All 55 tasks complete (100%)
### **Actual Status (Corrected)**: [X] 13 tasks complete (24%)

### **What Actually Works**
- ✅ **Simple Orchestrator**: Keyword-based routing (62 lines)
- ✅ **Deployment Advisor**: Basic collector selection (88 lines)
- ✅ **Error Handler**: Pattern matching database (94 lines)
- ✅ **Data Extractor**: MCP integration with asset analysis (155 lines)
- ✅ **Validator**: Component checking (130 lines)
- ✅ **Reporter**: SOW template engine (169 lines)
- ✅ **Command Integration**: Basic `/advisor:advise` and `/advisor:troubleshoot` delegation

### **What Doesn't Work (Specification Theater)**
- ❌ **Complex YAML Schemas**: Exist in `/specifications/` but not used by working agents
- ❌ **Flowchart Consultation**: Files exist but agents don't consult them
- ❌ **Advanced Error Handling**: No retry logic, circuit breakers, or escalation
- ❌ **Session Management**: No real-time storage, anonymization, or historical analysis
- ❌ **Complex Validation**: No SOW comparison or detailed state analysis

### **Key Transformation**
The system was **successfully transformed** from specification theater to working functionality using **KISS principles**, but the task list completion markers were misleading compared to actual implementation complexity.
