## Notes
- This is a Claude Code Agent System (not traditional program code) delivered as portable .md specification files
- Each agent follows standardized structure: name, description, tools, flows, and YAML communication schema
- Sequential sub-agent processing through Task tool invocation (no parallel execution)
- Session storage uses direct file writes to `/sessions/[customer_id]/[version]/` during conversations
- YAML communication format standardized across all sub-agents with retry logic and escalation handling
- Agent specifications define behavior first, then implementation follows the specification requirements
- All sub-agent communication must use the standardized YAML schema with status, data, errors, and retry_count fields
- MCP integration is centralized through data-extractor agent with exclusive Document360 access control

## TDD Planning Guidelines
When generating tasks, follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where feasible:
- **Agent Specification Testing:** Create agent specification files that define behavior, then implement agent logic
- **YAML Schema Validation:** Define YAML communication schemas, then implement validation logic
- **Command Processing:** Define command specifications, then implement command handlers
- **Flow Testing:** Create flowchart decision trees, then implement consultation logic
- **Session Management:** Define session storage schemas, then implement storage handlers

### **Key Transformation**
The system was **successfully transformed** from specification theater to working functionality using **KISS principles**, but the task list completion markers were misleading compared to actual implementation complexity.
